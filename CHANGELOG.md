# Changelog

All notable changes to the Wayfinder project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) where applicable.

## Philosophy

We maintain this changelog with the same values as the project:
- **Transparency**: Document all significant changes
- **Clarity**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- **Honesty**: Include mistakes and lessons learned
- **Attribution**: Credit contributors

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Level 1 materials (evidence mapping templates, PROMPT worksheets)
- First example investigation (to be determined based on beta tester feedback)
- Simple website (GitLab Pages or similar)
- Beta tester recruitment (5-10 journalists)

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2025-11-23

### Added - Project Foundation

#### Documentation
- **README.md**: Project overview, mission, learning pathway, quick start
- **claude.md**: Comprehensive documentation for AI assistants and deep project context
- **LICENSE.txt**: Dual MIT + Palimpsest v0.8 licensing
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Contribution guidelines aligned with heutagogic principles
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Community standards emphasizing epistemic virtues
- **SECURITY.md**: Security policy covering source protection, data handling, platform security
- **MAINTAINERS.md**: Governance model and maintainer responsibilities
- **CHANGELOG.md**: This file

#### Core Frameworks
- **PROMPT Framework**: Six-dimension claim evaluation
  - Provenance, Relevance, Objectivity, Methods, Perspective, Timeliness
- **Boundary Objects Theory**: Integration as conceptual foundation
  - Enables coordination without consensus
  - Multiple entry points for different communities
- **Data → Knowledge → Intelligence → Wisdom Pipeline**: Four-layer architecture
- **Bio-Psycho-Social-Technical Systems Analysis**: Cognitive science integration

#### Learning Pathway (Heutagogic Design)
- **Level 1**: Skeptical Journalist → Evidence Mapper (4-8 hours)
- **Level 2A**: Methodological Journalist → Process Documentarian (8-12 hours)
- **Level 2B**: Statistical Journalist → Uncertainty Communicator (6-10 hours)
- **Level 3**: Interactive Journalist → Knowledge Architect (20-40 hours)
- **Level 4**: Systems Journalist → Epistemic Infrastructure Builder (ongoing)

#### Cognitive Science Integration
- Progressive disclosure architecture (avoid cognitive overload)
- Meta-cognitive prompts (make thinking visible)
- Empathy-first contradictory evidence (reduce defensiveness)
- Transparent navigation analytics (show exploration patterns)
- Trust calibration mechanisms

#### Design Principles
- Face-saving architecture (never "you were wrong")
- Identity-safe framings (Kahan's cultural cognition)
- Multiple entry points (serve different communities)
- Collaborative investigation features
- Accessibility-first (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)

### Context - Why This Project Exists

This project emerged from recognition that:
1. **We're not in "post-truth"** but in transition from pre-truth to truth
2. **Data is outpacing** knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom
3. **Journalists are demoralized**, seeing "the end of journalism"
4. **Current approaches fail**: Ground News's algorithmic both-sidesism isn't enough
5. **Interactive documentaries** (i-docs) naturally address post-truth pathologies

### Influences and Inspiration

#### Theoretical Foundations
- **Nico Carpentier**: Participatory communication theory, PhD supervision
- **Susan Leigh Star**: Boundary objects theory
- **Ludwig Wittgenstein**: Late work on language games (vs. early truth-value semantics)
- **Dempster-Shafer Theory**: Uncertainty quantification
- **Granger Causality**: Temporal influence without mechanistic causation

#### Media and Methodology
- **i-Docs Research Network**: Interactive documentary frameworks
- **Korsakow**: Non-linear documentary software (SNUs - smallest narrative units)
- **Notable i-docs**: Out My Window, Hollow, Welcome to Pine Point, Prison Valley

#### Philosophy and Literature
- **De Man and Derrida**: Irony and the map-territory gap
- **David Foster Wallace**: New Sincerity movement
- **Profilicity vs. Authenticity**: Contemporary debates
- **Oxford OAR Group**: Inventive Methodologies (anecdotes as legitimate knowledge)

#### Cognitive Science
- **Cowan (2001)**: Working memory limits (~4 chunks)
- **Schwartz**: Choice paralysis
- **Rozenblit & Keil**: Illusion of explanatory depth
- **Kahan**: Cultural cognition and identity-protective reasoning
- **Nickerson**: Understanding disagreement reduces polarization

#### Professional Practice
- **National Union of Journalists (NUJ)**: Professional journalism standards
- **ProPublica**: Transparent methodology journalism
- **Knight Foundation, Omidyar Network**: Investigative journalism funding models

### Technical Decisions

#### Why Dual Licensing?
- **MIT**: Maximum compatibility, enables wide adoption
- **Palimpsest v0.8**: Values alignment, ensures transparency and epistemic justice
- Both apply; users choose which governs their use

#### Why This Documentation Structure?
- **README.md**: Quick orientation for humans
- **claude.md**: Deep context for AI assistants
- **Separate guides**: CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, etc.
  - Allows targeted reading
  - Easier to maintain
  - Clearer separation of concerns

#### Why "Wayfinder"?
- Captures both journalist role (guide) and reader experience (navigator)
- Signals hope to demoralized journalists
- Works as boundary object name (different communities hear what they need)
- Gamification-friendly (Apprentice/Journeyman/Master Wayfinder)
- Memorable, pronounceable, googleable

### Lessons Learned

#### What Worked
- **Delaying specific advice**: Asking questions before prescribing solutions
- **Cognitive science integration**: Design mitigations for known problems
- **Heutagogic approach**: Self-determination + results (not points/badges)
- **Boundary objects framing**: Solves "coordination without consensus" problem

#### What We're Watching
- **Production cost**: 10x more work than traditional journalism initially
- **Learning curve**: Both journalists and audiences need new capabilities
- **Business model**: No obvious revenue source yet
- **Measurement**: How to prove this works?

#### Open Questions
- Which complex story for first prototype?
- Obsidian vs. TiddlyWiki vs. Notion for Phase 1?
- How to recruit first 5-10 beta testers?
- What metrics actually matter for "success"?

### Status

**Current Phase**: Conceptual design complete, moving to proof-of-concept

**Next Milestones**:
1. Week 1: Level 1 materials, evidence mapping template, one example investigation
2. Week 2: Share with 3 journalist friends for feedback
3. Week 3: Build simple website (GitLab Pages)
4. Week 4: First 5-10 participants start Level 1

**4 weeks to proof-of-concept.**
