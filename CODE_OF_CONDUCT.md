# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to creating a community where:
- **Truth-seeking** is valued over being right
- **Learning** is celebrated, including learning from mistakes
- **Disagreement** is productive, not destructive
- **Everyone** can participate regardless of background, experience, or viewpoint
- **Epistemic humility** is practiced, not just preached

This isn't just a code of conduct—it's a model of the epistemic culture we're trying to build for journalism and public discourse.

## Our Standards

### Examples of Behavior That Contributes to Positive Community

#### Epistemic Virtues

- ✅ Celebrating others when they update their beliefs

#### Communication Virtues

- ✅ Providing context and sources for claims
- ✅ Showing your reasoning, not just conclusions
- ✅ Respecting others' cognitive load (structure, summaries, links)

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies:
- In project spaces (GitHub, GitLab, forums, chat)
- At events (conferences, workshops, meetups)
- When representing the project publicly
- In one-on-one interactions related to project work

It applies to everyone:
- Project maintainers
- Contributors (regular or occasional)
- Participants (learning, testing, using)
- Guests and visitors

## Enforcement

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:
- Clarifying standards of acceptable behavior
- Taking appropriate and fair corrective action
- Removing, editing, or rejecting contributions that violate this Code
- Banning temporarily or permanently anyone whose behavior is inappropriate

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **For immediate safety concerns**: Contact local authorities first

2. **For code violations**:
   - Email: [maintainers email - to be added]
   - Include:
     - Your contact information
     - Names of people involved
     - Your account of what happened
     - Any supporting documentation (links, screenshots)
     - Whether you want this to remain confidential

3. **What happens next**:
   - We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
   - We'll investigate (talking to all parties)
   - We'll decide on appropriate response
   - We'll inform you of the outcome
   - We'll protect your privacy

### Enforcement Guidelines

We follow graduated responses based on severity and pattern:

#### Level 1: Correction
**Behavior**: Minor violation (unintentional, first time)
**Response**: Private message explaining the issue
**Outcome**: Apology and behavior change expected

#### Level 2: Warning
**Behavior**: Moderate violation or repeated minor violations
**Response**: Formal written warning
**Outcome**: Clear expectations for future behavior

#### Level 3: Temporary Ban
**Behavior**: Serious violation or pattern of problematic behavior
**Response**: Temporary removal from community spaces (1-90 days)
**Outcome**: Conditions for return clearly stated

#### Level 4: Permanent Ban
**Behavior**: Severe violation, harassment, or repeated pattern
**Response**: Permanent removal from all project spaces
**Outcome**: No path to return

### Appeals

You may appeal an enforcement decision:
- Email maintainers within 14 days
- Explain why you believe the decision was incorrect
- Provide any relevant new information
- Maintainers will review and respond within 14 days

## Special Note on Intellectual Disagreement

**Disagreement is not a violation.**

We distinguish between:

✅ **Productive disagreement**:
- "I interpret this evidence differently because..."
- "Have you considered this alternative explanation?"
- "I don't find that argument convincing, here's why..."

❌ **Unproductive disagreement**:
- "You're an idiot if you believe that"
- "Anyone who thinks X is morally bankrupt"
- "I'm not going to explain why you're wrong, educate yourself"

**We want vigorous intellectual debate.** We don't want personal attacks disguised as intellectual critique.

## Special Note on Epistemic Justice

Part of our mission is making knowledge creation more equitable. This means:

- **Lived experience is a form of expertise** (though not the only form)
- **Different epistemologies are valid** (academic, journalistic, community-based, etc.)
- **Power shapes knowledge** (acknowledge whose perspectives are centered/marginalized)
- **Access should be democratic** (don't create barriers based on credentials or payment)

If someone says "X policy harms my community," don't demand they provide peer-reviewed studies. Listen, ask questions, and take seriously their expertise about their own experience.

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether something violates this Code:
- When in doubt, ask!
- Email maintainers for private guidance
- Open an issue for public discussion of edge cases

We'd rather you ask than worry in silence.

## Our Promise

We are building a community that models the epistemic culture we want for journalism and public discourse:

- Where changing your mind is strength, not weakness
- Where "I don't know" is an acceptable answer
- Where disagreement leads to understanding, not division
- Where everyone can contribute, regardless of background
- Where truth-seeking matters more than being right

Thank you for helping us create this space.
