# Maintainers

This document lists the people responsible for maintaining the Wayfinder project and making final decisions when consensus can't be reached.

## Philosophy

Wayfinder practices **distributed maintainership** where:
- Decisions are made transparently
- Authority comes from demonstrated capability
- Disagreement is welcomed
- No one person owns the project
- The community can fork if governance fails

## Current Maintainers

### Project Lead

**[Name to be added]**
- Role: Project inception, overall vision, PhD research integration
- Areas: Epistemology, journalism practice, cognitive science
- Contact: [email to be added]
- GitHub/GitLab: [username to be added]
- Affiliation: PhD candidate under Nico Carpentier, NUJ member

### Core Maintainers

[To be added as project grows]

## Maintainer Responsibilities

### All Maintainers

- **Code Review**: Review and merge pull requests
- **Issue Triage**: Respond to and categorize issues
- **Community Support**: Answer questions, help newcomers
- **Documentation**: Keep docs accurate and current
- **Standards**: Uphold Code of Conduct and contribution guidelines
- **Transparency**: Document decisions and reasoning
- **Epistemic Humility**: Admit mistakes, update beliefs

### Specific Domains (As Project Grows)

- **Research**: Academic integration, study design, evaluation
- **Journalism**: Professional practice, NUJ liaison, training
- **Development**: Code architecture, security, performance
- **Design**: UX/UI, accessibility, information architecture
- **Community**: Events, communications, conflict resolution

## Decision-Making Process

### Types of Decisions

#### 1. Day-to-Day (Any Maintainer)
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Minor feature tweaks
- Issue triage

#### 2. Significant (Consensus of Active Maintainers)
- New features
- Architecture changes
- API changes
- Policy updates

#### 3. Major (Community Discussion + Maintainer Decision)
- Mission/vision changes
- Licensing changes
- Governance changes
- Major pivots

### Consensus Process

1. **Proposal**: Maintainer proposes in issue/PR with rationale
2. **Discussion**: Minimum 7 days for community input
3. **Synthesis**: Maintainer incorporates feedback, shows reasoning
4. **Decision**: Made transparently with documented rationale

### When Consensus Fails

If maintainers disagree and can't reach consensus:

1. **Time-box**: Set deadline for decision (usually 30 days)
2. **Investigate**: Each side documents their case thoroughly
3. **Consult**: Seek external expertise if needed
4. **Decide**: Project Lead makes final call (with full transparency)
5. **Document**: Record decision, reasoning, and dissent
6. **Revisit**: Set date to revisit decision based on evidence

### The Fork Option

If the community strongly disagrees with a maintainer decision:
- You can fork the project (that's what open source means)
- We'll support your fork and link to it
- Disagreement about direction doesn't mean anyone was wrong

## Becoming a Maintainer

### Criteria

Maintainers are:
- **Trusted**: Demonstrated good judgment and community respect
- **Active**: Consistently contributing (not necessarily daily, but regularly)
- **Skilled**: Expert in their domain (code, research, journalism, design, etc.)
- **Aligned**: Committed to project values (transparency, epistemic justice, etc.)
- **Humble**: Can admit mistakes and change minds

### Process

1. **Nomination**: Current maintainer nominates candidate
2. **Portfolio**: Candidate shows track record of contributions
3. **Interview**: Discussion about vision, approach, commitment
4. **Consensus**: Existing maintainers approve
5. **Onboarding**: Access granted, responsibilities explained
6. **Announcement**: Public welcome to new maintainer

### Not a Hierarchy

Being a maintainer is about responsibility, not status. It means:
- You've committed to sustained involvement
- You're trusted to make good decisions
- You're accountable to the community

It doesn't mean:
- You're better than contributors
- Your ideas matter more
- You can ignore feedback

## Stepping Down

Maintainers can step down any time:
- Life circumstances change
- Interests shift
- Burnout happens
- Projects end

**No judgment, no guilt.**

To step down:
1. Notify other maintainers (private is fine)
2. Help transition your responsibilities
3. Update this file
4. Public thanks for your service

We celebrate your contributions and wish you well.

## Contact

### Public
- **Issues**: Use GitHub/GitLab issues for project discussions
- **Forum**: [Community forum to be established]
- **Email**: maintainers@wayfinder.org [to be established]

### Private
- **Email**: [Private maintainer contact]
- **Urgent**: [Emergency contact for security/safety issues]

### Response Times

We aim for:
- **Security issues**: 48 hours
- **Code of Conduct reports**: 48 hours
- **Pull requests**: 1 week for initial review
- **Issues**: 1 week for initial triage
- **General email**: 2 weeks

Life happens. These are goals, not guarantees.

## Conflict of Interest

Maintainers should disclose conflicts of interest:
- Financial (paid by interested party)
- Professional (employer has stake)
- Personal (close relationship with affected party)

Disclosure doesn't disqualify you from decisions, but helps context.

## Maintainer Tenure

We don't have term limits. Maintainers serve as long as:
- They're active and engaged
- They uphold project values
- They have community trust

## Removing a Maintainer

In extreme cases (serious Code of Conduct violation, sustained inactivity, loss of trust), a maintainer can be removed:

1. **Discussion**: Private conversation with maintainer
2. **Community Input**: If needed, gather community feedback
3. **Decision**: Consensus of other maintainers
4. **Transparency**: Public announcement with reasoning (respecting privacy)
5. **Appeals**: Removed maintainer can appeal to community

This should be rare. We'd rather help people improve or step down gracefully.

## Succession Planning

If Project Lead becomes unavailable:
- Core maintainers collectively make decisions
- Community selects new lead if needed
- Project continues (it's not dependent on one person)

## Evolution of Governance

This governance model will evolve:
- Based on what works
- As project grows
- When community needs change

Proposed changes follow Major Decision process (see above).

## Acknowledgments

This governance model draws from:
- Rust project governance
- Django project governance
- Apache Foundation governance
- Principles of do-ocracy and meritocracy (with awareness of their limitations)

## Questions?

If you have questions about governance:
- Open an issue for public discussion
- Email maintainers for private questions
- Propose changes via pull request
