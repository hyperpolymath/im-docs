# Contributing to Wayfinder

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wayfinder! This project embodies the principles it teaches: transparency, collaboration, epistemic humility, and democratic accessibility.

## Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Building in public**: All development visible, all decisions documented
- **Self-determination**: Contributors choose their own paths and priorities
- **Results over credentials**: What you build matters more than your resume
- **Learning by doing**: Contribution is a capability-building journey
- **Epistemic humility**: We can be wrong and want to know when we are

## Ways to Contribute

## Getting Started

### 1. Introduce Yourself (Optional but Welcome)

Create a GitHub/GitLab issue or join our community space:

- What you might want to contribute
- No pressure - just helps us connect people

### 2. Choose Your Entry Point

**Skeptical?** Try Level 1 (4 hours) and see if it resonates.

**Ready to build?** Pick a task from our issues or propose your own.

**Want to research?** Review our [claude.md](./claude.md) and identify research questions.

**Prefer to discuss?** Join our async community forum.

### 3. Work Openly

- Fork the repository
- Create a branch for your work
- Commit regularly with clear messages
- Document your process (show your work!)
- Open a pull request when ready

### 4. Accept Feedback Gracefully

- We review with epistemic humility (we might be wrong)
- Critique is about ideas, not people
- Disagreement is productive if done well
- You can always say "I need time to think about this"

## Contribution Standards

### For Documentation

- **Clarity**: Can a non-expert understand this?
- **Examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Humility**: Acknowledge limitations
- **Attribution**: Credit sources and influences

### For Research

- **Transparency**: Share methodology and data
- **Uncertainty**: Communicate confidence levels
- **Replicability**: Others should be able to verify
- **Ethics**: IRB approval where required

### For Investigations

- **PROMPT Framework**: Score all major claims
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Seek missing viewpoints
- **Source Transparency**: Show your evidence
- **Methodology Visibility**: Document your process

## Review Process

### We Look For

1. **Alignment with Values**
   - Transparency in methodology
   - Democratic accessibility
   - Epistemic justice
   - Collaborative spirit

2. **Quality of Execution**
   - Does it work?
   - Is it well-documented?
   - Is it accessible?
   - Does it show the work?

3. **Contribution to Mission**
   - Does this help journalists?
   - Does this advance truth-seeking?
   - Does this build epistemic infrastructure?

### Timeline

- **First response**: Within 1 week
- **Initial review**: Within 2 weeks
- **Complex changes**: May take longer

We're a small team. Patience appreciated.

### If We Say No

We might decline a contribution if:
- It doesn't align with project values
- It adds complexity without clear value
- It duplicates existing work
- We lack capacity to maintain it

This isn't a judgment of you or your work. Sometimes the fit isn't right.

## Communication Guidelines

### Be Kind and Constructive

- Assume good faith
- Attack ideas, not people
- Use "I" statements ("I found X confusing" not "X is confusing")
- Ask questions before assuming

### Show Your Work

- Share reasoning, not just conclusions
- Link to sources and evidence
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Make your thought process visible

### Welcome Disagreement

- Disagreement is a gift (it shows what needs clarity)
- Steel man opposing views (present them at their strongest)
- Update your beliefs when evidence warrants
- It's okay to say "I don't know"

### Respect Cognitive Load

- Break long messages into digestible chunks
- Use headings and structure
- Summarize complex points
- Link to details rather than dumping everything upfront

## Recognition

### We Celebrate

- **Epistemic flexibility**: Changing your mind publicly
- **Generosity**: Helping others learn
- **Transparency**: Sharing failures as well as successes
- **Innovation**: Trying new approaches
- **Persistence**: Working through hard problems
