*Status*: Conceptual Design → Proof of Concept Development

Wayfinder is a heutagogic capability development pathway and interactive journalism framework designed to transform journalism from static truth-claims into navigable knowledge ecosystems.

== The Problem

We haven't moved from "Truth to Post-Truth" but from an era where knowledge systems were simpler to one where they're overwhelmed by data velocity. *Data is outpacing knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom.*

Traditional journalism says: "Here's what happened."
Wayfinder says: "Here's the evidence ecosystem. Navigate it. Understand how we know."

== The Solution

Wayfinder creates *boundary objects*—interactive investigations that serve different communities while maintaining evidential coherence:

- *Activists*: Tool for mobilization
- *Policymakers*: Decision support system
- *Academics*: Research resource
- *Skeptics*: Challenge mechanism
- *Affected Communities*: Validation and voice
- *Journalists*: Living investigation

All use the SAME evidence but interpret it for their needs. This enables *coordination without consensus*.

== Core Framework: PROMPT

Every claim is evaluated across six dimensions:

- *P*rovenance: Who said it? What's their track record?
- *R*elevance: Does this actually address the claim?
- *O*bjectivity: What biases exist? Are they disclosed?
- *M*ethods: How was evidence gathered? Is it sound?
- *P*erspective: What viewpoints are represented? What's missing?
- *T*imeliness: Is this current? Has it been superseded?

== Knowledge Pipeline: Data → Knowledge → Intelligence → Wisdom

Traditional journalism conflates all four. Wayfinder separates and makes each navigable:

1. *Data Layer*: Raw evidence, fully accessible
2. *Knowledge Layer*: Structured claims with PROMPT analysis
3. *Intelligence Layer*: Pattern recognition, contradiction identification
4. *Wisdom Layer*: Practical reasoning for decision-making

== For Demoralized Journalists

> "You're not obsolete. You're needed more than ever—but as Wayfinders, not gatekeepers. People need guides who show them HOW to navigate complexity, not just WHAT to believe."

=== The Learning Pathway

Self-directed, result-focused capability development:

- *Level 1* (4-8 hours): Evidence Mapper - Map one claim's evidence using PROMPT
- *Level 2A* (8-12 hours): Process Documentarian - Show your methodology transparently
- *Level 2B* (6-10 hours): Uncertainty Communicator - Replace false certainty with honest uncertainty
- *Level 3* (20-40 hours): Knowledge Architect - Create full interactive investigation
- *Level 4* (Ongoing): Epistemic Infrastructure Builder - Build tools, teach others

Each level produces *usable professional outputs*, not just learning badges.

== Quick Start

=== For Beta Testers (Journalists)

1. *Read*: [claude.md](./claude.md) for full context
2. *Try*: Level 1 Evidence Mapping (4 hours)
   - Choose one claim you're currently reporting
   - Apply PROMPT framework to evaluate evidence
   - See immediate value in your work
3. *Decide*: Continue or not (no pressure)

=== For Academic Partners

- *PhD Integration*: This research can be dissertation work
- *Curriculum Development*: Level 1-3 as journalism course modules
- *Research Questions*: Measuring impact on comprehension, trust, behavior change

=== For Developers

- *Phase 1* (NOW): Obsidian/TiddlyWiki/Notion prototypes
- *Phase 2* (3-9 months): SvelteKit + PostgreSQL + graph database custom platform
- *Phase 3* (9-18 months): Ecosystem building, community tools

== Theoretical Foundations

=== Boundary Objects (Susan Leigh Star)
Objects that maintain coherence across communities while adapting to local needs, enabling coordination without consensus.

=== Cognitive Science Integration
- Progressive disclosure (avoid cognitive overload)
- Meta-cognitive prompts (make thinking visible)
- Empathy-first contradictory evidence (reduce defensiveness)
- Transparent navigation analytics (show exploration patterns)

=== Bio-Psycho-Social-Technical Systems
Designed considering biological attention limits, psychological identity protection, social collective sense-making, and technical accessibility requirements.

== Project Status

=== Completed
- ✅ Conceptual framework (PROMPT, boundary objects, heutagogic design)
- ✅ Four-level capability pathway design
- ✅ Cognitive science integration
- ✅ SWOT analysis
- ✅ Technical architecture planning

=== In Progress
- 🔄 Level 1 materials development
- 🔄 Evidence mapping templates
- 🔄 First example investigation

=== Next Steps (Week 1-4)
- Week 1: Document Level 1 pathway, create evidence mapping template, build one example
- Week 2: Share with 3 journalist friends for feedback
- Week 3: Build simple website (GitLab Pages)
- Week 4: First 5-10 participants start Level 1

== Contact & Collaboration

*Looking For*:
- Beta-testing journalists (especially demoralized ones!)
- Academic partners (journalism schools, media studies)
- Funders (Knight Foundation, Omidyar Network, European Media & Information Fund)
- Developers (SvelteKit, PostgreSQL, D3.js)
- i-Docs practitioners
- Cognitive scientists interested in epistemic interfaces

*Philosophy*: Build in public, open source from day one, collaborative not competitive.
