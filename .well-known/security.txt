# - Privacy violations
# - Platform vulnerabilities
# - Attribution errors

# Responsible Disclosure
# We ask for 90 days to fix most issues before public disclosure.
# We will not take legal action against good-faith security researchers.
# We credit researchers who help us (unless you prefer anonymity).
