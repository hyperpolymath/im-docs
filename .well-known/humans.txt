## The Demoralized Journalists

Who said "journalism is dying" and sparked this work
You're not obsolete. You're Wayfinders.

Fonts: System fonts (performance + accessibility)
Performance: Static site generation where possible

# VALUES

Epistemic Humility: We can be wrong
Transparency: Show the work
Democratic Accessibility: Knowledge for all
Epistemic Justice: Multiple valid ways of knowing
Collaboration: Build together, not compete
Boundary Objects: Coordination without consensus

# PHILOSOPHY

Not "post-truth" but "pre-truth to truth"
Data outpaces knowledge, intelligence, wisdom
Journalists as Wayfinders, not gatekeepers
Interactive navigation, not passive consumption
Living documents, not fixed products
Multiple perspectives without false equivalence

# FOUNDING QUESTIONS

1. Why is journalism failing to address misinformation?
   Answer: Using 20th-century methods for 21st-century complexity

2. What do demoralized journalists need?
   Answer: New capabilities that make them more valuable, not obsolete

3. How can we navigate complexity without claiming false certainty?
   Answer: Make epistemological processes visible and navigable

4. How can different communities use the same evidence?
   Answer: Boundary objects that adapt to local needs

5. How can we move from data to wisdom?
   Answer: Four-layer architecture (Data → Knowledge → Intelligence → Wisdom)

# INSPIRATION

The journalists who ask "How do I report truth when truth is contested?"
The readers who say "I don't know what to believe anymore"
The academics who study "How do we know what we know?"
The developers who build "How do we make knowledge navigable?"
The humans who insist truth still matters

# DEDICATION

To everyone trying to navigate complexity with integrity.
To journalists who won't give up despite everything.
To readers who ask "How do you know?" instead of "What do you think?"
To anyone building bridges instead of walls.

This is for you.

# META

Yes, we know it's ironic to use humans.txt (a file for humans)
to document a project about making knowledge navigable.

That's exactly the point.

The map is not the territory.
The documentation is not the project.
The framework is not the truth.

But they can help you navigate toward truth.

That's what Wayfinding is.

# THANK YOU

For reading this far.
For caring about truth.
For being willing to navigate complexity.
For building something better.

You're a Wayfinder too.
